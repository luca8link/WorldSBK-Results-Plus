# WorldSBK Results Plus

An unofficial browser extension that enhances results **and standings** pages on [worldsbk.com](https://www.worldsbk.com): **gap** columns (to the leader and the rider ahead), **championship points** on race sessions, **points-gap** columns and a **leader-advantage** summary on the standings, and quick access to the official **Results** and **Standings** PDFs — so you can read everything at a glance.


## What it does

![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

WorldSBK results tables list each rider's lap/race time but not the gaps. This extension parses those times and injects two cells right after the time column:

- **Gap 1st** — difference to the session/race leader
- **Gap Prev** — difference to the rider immediately ahead

It works on two table layouts:

- **Practice / qualifying** tables, where every row shows an absolute lap time (`1'32.733`)
- **Race** tables, where P1 shows a full time and everyone else shows `+gap` — the extension reconstructs each absolute time (`leader + gap`) so both columns stay correct

### Championship points (race sessions only)

When the selected session is a race, a **Pts** column is added with the points each rider scored, based on finishing position. The session is identified from the URL's session code (`001` = Race 1, `002` = Superpole Race, `003` = Race 2), and the correct scale is chosen automatically:

- **Race 1 / Race 2** — full scale, top 15 score: `25, 20, 16, 13, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1`
- **Superpole Race** — sprint scale, top 9 score: `12, 10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2`

Practice and qualifying sessions get no points column. Unclassified riders (DNF/DNS) show `–`.

### Championship standings

On a championship **standings** table the extension adds the same two gap columns, but measured in **points**: **Gap 1st** (points behind the leader) and **Gap Prev** (points behind the rider directly ahead), shown as a deficit such as `-94`. The leader shows `0`, and riders level on points show `0`.

Above the table it also adds a one-line **leader summary**: how far the championship leader is ahead of 2nd place, expressed in race wins (`25` pts) and full weekends (`62` pts = two race wins + a Superpole Race win), plus how many weekends remain in the season. A lead of one weekend over 2nd is by definition a lead over everyone below it, so only the gap to 2nd is measured; remaining weekends are counted from the site's upcoming-events rail.

### Official PDFs (Results & Standings)

Below the results widget, the extension appends a PDF panel for the page you're on, and a smooth-scroll "jump" link just above the results that animates down to it. The **Results** PDF is offered on every session; the **Championship Standings** PDF is added only on race sessions (where it exists), shown as a second tab. URLs come from the links the site already provides when present, otherwise they're built from the page's path segments (year / event / category / session) plus a fixed tail (`CLA/Results.pdf`, `STD/ChampionshipStandings.pdf`). PDFs embed inline where the browser allows it, and fall back to an "open in new tab" link when inline embedding is blocked.

### The toolbar popup

Clicking the extension's toolbar icon opens a small popup with the version, a shortcut to the WorldSBK **results** page, and a link to support development. It's informational only — no settings to configure, and nothing is stored.

## Install (Chrome / Edge / Brave)

Until it's on the Chrome Web Store, load it unpacked.

**1. Get the files from GitHub** — either:

- **Download ZIP:** open the [repository page](https://github.com/luca8link/WorldSBK-Results-Plus), click the green **Code** button, choose **Download ZIP**, then unzip it somewhere you'll remember.
- **Or clone with git:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/luca8link/WorldSBK-Results-Plus.git
  ```

**2. Load it into your browser:**

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the folder that contains `manifest.json` — if you downloaded the ZIP, that's the unzipped folder (e.g. `WorldSBK-Results-Plus`)
5. Open any WorldSBK results or standings page and reload

## Install (Safari)

Safari supports the same Web Extension format, but distribution goes through a native app wrapper. On a Mac with Xcode:

```bash
xcrun safari-web-extension-converter /path/to/this/folder
```

Then build the generated project in Xcode. For local testing, enable **Allow unsigned extensions** in Safari's Develop menu. Publishing to the App Store requires the Apple Developer Program.

## How it works

- A content script (`content.js`) runs on `worldsbk.com` pages.
- Lap times are parsed from the `M'SS.mmm` (or `+gap`) format into seconds, gaps are computed, and two cells are appended per row.
- Injected cells are tagged with a class and **cleared/rebuilt on every run**, so the script is idempotent across lazy-loads, live-timing updates, and SPA navigation.
- A debounced `MutationObserver` (disconnected during its own edits to avoid a feedback loop) catches the site's lazy rendering.
- Unparseable values (`DNF`, `+1 Lap`, blanks) render as `–` and don't corrupt the running gap references.
- On championship standings the same approach adds points-gap columns and a leader-advantage summary (the leader's margin over 2nd in race wins and weekends, plus weekends remaining).

No permissions are requested beyond a content-script match on a single domain. The extension reads the page DOM only and stores nothing.
